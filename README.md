# AI-Powered Marketing Experimentation & A/B Testing Engine

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was built to simulate a real-world marketing experimentation scenario where multiple campaigns are tested to identify the most effective strategy. I designed this project to practice applying A/B testing, statistical analysis, and data visualization to solve practical business problems faced by marketing teams.

The focus of this project is not just on analysis, but on translating data into clear, actionable insights that support business decision-making.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Marketing teams often run multiple campaigns but struggle to confidently answer questions such as:
- Which campaign performs better?
- Are performance differences statistically significant or due to random variation?
- Can the winning strategy be safely scaled?

This project demonstrates how A/B testing and statistical methods can be used to answer these questions in a structured, data-driven way.

## 📊 Dashboard: A/B Testing Performance Overview
The dashboard compares control and treatment groups using key metrics such as conversion rate, uplift, and overall campaign performance. It is designed to help stakeholders quickly understand results and make informed marketing decisions.

---

## 🧠 Analytical Approach
1. Cleaned and prepared the marketing dataset using Python (Pandas and NumPy)
2. Defined control and treatment groups for experimentation
3. Formulated null and alternative hypotheses
4. Performed A/B testing and statistical significance analysis
5. Applied regression analysis to identify key factors influencing conversion
6. Visualized insights using Power BI dashboards for business users
7. Selected statistical methods based on data distribution and business context to ensure reliable decision-making

## 📌 Result
- Treatment campaign gave better results than control campaign  
- Results were statistically significant  
- Treatment campaign is recommended for future use  

---
## 📈 Key Insights
- The treatment campaign demonstrated a clear improvement in conversion rate compared to the control group
- Statistical testing confirmed that the observed uplift was significant and not due to random chance
- Regression analysis highlighted important drivers affecting campaign performance
- Insights from the dashboard support confident, data-backed marketing decisions
- Based on the results, the treatment campaign is recommended for future marketing experiments
- This analysis provides a framework for making confident go/no-go campaign decisions using data rather than assumptions
